        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <p class="emphasis">
            There is so much data about sustainability that exists, 
            but there is no was to easily grasp the current situation.
        </p>
        
        <p class="emphasis">Project LUM changes that.</p>

        <div class="text-block">
            <p>While brainstorming ideas for this Make-A-Thon, 
                our chief goal was to make something that was actually impactful. 
                So, we set out to find some of the biggest environmental problems. 
                We found a hodgepodge of reports from the local level, all the way up to the international stage. 
                We also found resources that could be really useful if we paid a lot of money for them, 
                or had degrees in information science. However, despite hours of research, 
                the opaque and complex patchwork of resources didn’t allow us to get a very good picture of the current 
                sustainability landscape and where our time and resources would be best spent.
            </p>
            <img src="graphics/LUM_Tab_Icon_03.png"/>
        </div>

        <div class="text-block">
            <img src="graphics/LUM_Tab_Icon_03.png"/>
            <p>This seemed like a problem. 
                If we couldn’t find the numbers we needed for a Make-A-Thon, 
                then what was it like to be a researcher, an activist group, a local government, 
                or a country seeking information on sustainability metrics. It seemed like a 
                problem so urgent, in fact, that we decided we needed to do something about it. 
                And with that, we developed the beginnings of Project LUM, a non-profit with the 
                goal of providing intuitive statistical summaries of sustainability metrics to the globe.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p class="emphasis">Project LUM is certainly environmentally sustainable: 
            all we need is the internet, our computers, and teamwork. We expect 
            the positive environmental impact of the site could be limitless, as it’s only 
            limited by the imaginations of those who decide to use it as their tool.
        </p>

        <h1>The Problem</h1>

        <div class="text-block">
            <p>
                When faced with a wicked problem like climate change, data is essential. 
                Thus, it is no surprise that organizations and governments often keep records 
                of energy and water usage. This is wonderful news! However, there are no tools 
                for quickly putting one’s fingers on the pulse of current measures of sustainability. 
                The patchwork of resources that exist are complex and largely scholastic, requiring 
                massive amounts of time, research, money, and expertise in order to extract useful 
                insight. And even when there are intuitive resources, they often focus on specific 
                locations and become quickly outdated, leaving massive holes in one’s understanding 
                of the sustainability landscape. This circumstance disincentivizes low-budget 
                initiatives from creating truly impactful change, for individuals can’t easily 
                discover 1) what the biggest problems are, and 2) how they vary between communities.

                Many graphics don't show the data we care about in regards to climate change.
                Additionally, they are pretty dense and hard to interpret.

            <p>
                This chart is already outdated. Also, units like Trillion Btu are not very user friendly.

                This data is very raw, and only 1 out of 58 spreadsheet with Netherland's energy data, each
                with over 100,000 rows. Not for the average individual.

                Here is part of a UN report, sent out in PDF format. Lots of missing data, and the data that exists
                is already aggregated.

            <p>
                ArcGIS is a great resource for librarians and academics with access to this resource,
                but it is neither user friendly nor accesible for most people.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h1>The Solution</h1>

        <div class="text-block">
            <p>
                Project LUM is an accessible online data hub, which elegantly displays statistical 
                summaries of sustainability metrics. Our data hub is designed to harmonize with the 
                lives of real people: the intuitive design will break information barriers by inspiring 
                journalists to write stories about cross-community comparisons, arming activist groups 
                with the statistics they need to effect change, and empowering individuals with a launch 
                pad for their curiosity, research, and innovation.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-block">
            <p>
                Project LUM is a living project, which will grow and change with human civilization. 
                The first steps of our journey will focus on gathering the low-hanging fruit: find 
                and analyze the high-quality data that already exists so that everyday people can 
                begin to benefit from the insights generated from these rich resources. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-block">
            <p>
                This means, however, that the metrics displayed by our site will be limited (for now) 
                by what is currently measured. The hope, however, is that as Project LUM expands, 
                organizations and governments will become increasingly motivated and excited to take 
                part in this ambitious project to document humanity’s resource consumption in a time 
                of grave need. To that end, we expect our metrics to expand and change with 
                humanity--and we like it that way.
            </p>
        </div>


        <h1>Substantiation</h1>

        <h2>Project LUM is environmentally sustainable.</h2>

        <div class="text-block">
            <p>
                This speaks for itself: since we didn’t create a product so much as a virtually-hosted 
                project, we aren’t producing anything harmful. We don’t need extra computers, or material 
                items that don’t already exist. All we need is data, community, and cooperation. 
                The positive environmental impact that could come of it, however, is limitless: we 
                expect people will build grassroots campaigns, complete research, and start companies 
                based on the data that becomes available via Project LUM. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Project LUM is socially sustainable.</h2>

        <div class="text-block">
            <p>
                When people have good tools, they use them well. 
                Project LUM seeks to empower those who don’t have the time, money, 
                or expertise to glean insight from opaque sustainability data sources of the present. 
                Our belief is that when people are armed with intuitive, accurate information, they use 
                it to further their own interests. We saw this with the printing press, then again with 
                Google, and we see no reason why LUM should be any different. We hope LUM will provide 
                a starting point for everything from individual curiosity to international climate action. 
                <br/><br/>
                <br/><br/>
                Also, we pride ourselves in collecting absolutely no personal data: we do not have user 
                logins, and the most granular data we will ever publish is at the multi-story building 
                level. Further, if an organization wishes to decline cooperating with Project LUM, they 
                certainly may (although we hope they’ll be enthusiastic to join in on this exciting mission!).
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Project LUM is economically sustainable.</h2>

        <div class="text-block">
            <p>
                Project LUM prioritizes accessibility and delightful user experience, which means we neither 
                charge for our website, nor sponsor advertisements on our website. That leaves us with a 
                non-profit model as the most viable option, at least in the beginning phases of development. 
                <br/><br/>
                <br/><br/>
                Luckily, however, Project LUM does not cost money. It costs time and knowledge. Thus, our 
                largest cost will be compensating the people pouring their time and knowledge into the project. 
                However, we believe many entities would be interested in helping a tool like this flourish. Thus, 
                we expect we can receive funding from foundations, research institutions, and governments.
