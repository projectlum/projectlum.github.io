        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <p class="emphasis">
            There is so much data about sustainability that exists, 
            but there is no was to easily grasp the current situation.
        </p>
        
        <p class="emphasis">Project LUM changes that.</p>

        <!-- <h2>Background</h2> -->

        <div class="text-block">
            <p>While brainstorming ideas for this Make-A-Thon, 
                our chief goal was to make something that was actually impactful. 
                So, we set out to find some of the biggest environmental problems. 
                We found a hodgepodge of reports from the local level, all the way up to the international stage. 
                We also found resources that could be really useful if we paid a lot of money for them, 
                or had degrees in information science. However, despite hours of research, 
                the opaque and complex patchwork of resources didn’t allow us to get a very good picture of the current 
                sustainability landscape and where our time and resources would be best spent.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="text-block-reverse">
            <p>This seemed like a problem. 
                If we couldn’t find the numbers we needed for a Make-A-Thon, 
                then what was it like to be a researcher, an activist group, a local government, 
                or a country seeking information on sustainability metrics. It seemed like a 
                problem so urgent, in fact, that we decided we needed to do something about it. 
                And with that, we developed the beginnings of Project LUM, a non-profit with the 
                goal of providing intuitive statistical summaries of sustainability metrics to the globe.
            </p>
            <img src="graphics/LUM_Tab_Icon_03.png"/>
        </div>

        <p class="emphasis">Project LUM is certainly environmentally sustainable: 
            all we need is the internet, our computers, and teamwork. We expect 
            the positive environmental impact of the site could be limitless, as it’s only 
            limited by the imaginations of those who decide to use it as their tool.
